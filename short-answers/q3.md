# Question
What is polymorphism? Show an example in a code snippet.

# Answer
Polymorphism is connected to the inheritance and the methods name is also the same.

```js
class Pet {
  constructor(name,type){
    this.name = name
    this.type = type
  }
  speak(){
    console.log('the pet speaks')
  }
}

class Dog extends Pet {
  constructor(name,type){
      super(name,type)
  }

  speak(){
    console.log("I am a dog");
  }
}
const cat = new Pet("Mia", "Cat")
cat.speak() // logs 'the pet speaks'

const doggo = new Dog("Charlie", "Big")
doggo.speak() // logs 'I am a dog'
```

Not quite! Polymorphism is directly correlated to inheritance another main component of polymorphism is that the method name is the same but the implementation is different! Look at the example below!

```js
class Pet {
  constructor(name,type){
    this.name = name
    this.type = type
  }
  speak(){
    console.log('the pet speaks')
  }
}

class Dog extends Pet {
  constructor(name,type){
      super(name,type)
  }

  speak(){
    console.log("I am a dog");
  }
}
const cat = new Pet("Mia", "Cat")
cat.speak() // logs 'the pet speaks'

const doggo = new Dog("Charlie", "Big")
doggo.speak() // logs 'I am a dog'
```
