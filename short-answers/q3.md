# Question
What is polymorphism? Show an example in a code snippet.

# Answer
Polymorphism is connected to the inheritance and the methods name is also the same.

```js
class Pet {
  constructor(name,type){
    this.name = name
    this.type = type
  }
  speak(){
    console.log('the pet speaks')
  }
}

class Dog extends Pet {
  constructor(name,type){
      super(name,type)
  }

  speak(){
    console.log("I am a dog");
  }
}
const cat = new Pet("Mia", "Cat")
cat.speak() // logs 'the pet speaks'

const doggo = new Dog("Charlie", "Big")
doggo.speak() // logs 'I am a dog'
```
