# Question
What is polymorphism? Show an example in a code snippet.

# Answer
Polymorphism is when you treat objects of different classes as instances for a superclass.
```js
class Person {
    constructor(name, age){
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
}

class Greet(){
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);
}
//Poly
const Greet(Person) {
  Person.Greet(); 
}
```
