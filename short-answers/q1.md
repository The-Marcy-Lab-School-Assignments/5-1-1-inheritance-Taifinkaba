# Question
What's the difference between an `instance` method and a `class` method?

# Answer
`instance` is used to at that exact moment and is used when called on.
`class` method is a static method and is used inside the class itself and doesn't create a instance. `Class` can be called directly on itself with the `static` keyword and `instance` calls on instances that need to be created first.

Your response is a bit unclear but I think you were really close! We call instance methods on instances that need to first be created, after creation then we can invoke those instance methods. Class methods can be called on the class directly and need the `static` keyword!
