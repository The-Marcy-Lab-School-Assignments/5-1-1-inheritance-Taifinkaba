# Question
What's the difference between an `instance` method and a `class` method?

# Answer
`instance` is used to at that exact moment and is used when called on.
`class` method is a static method and is used inside the class itself and doesn't create a instance. `Class` can be called directly on itself with the `static` keyword and `instance` calls on instances that need to be created first.

Yup! Class methods are used directly on the class and instance methods are used on the instances of that class!
