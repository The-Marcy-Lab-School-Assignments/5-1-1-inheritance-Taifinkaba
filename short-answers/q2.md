# Question
In a code snippet, demonstrate inheritance by creating two classes where one is the parent class and one is the child class.

In your code example, create an instance of the child class and reference/invoke a property/method of the parent class.

# Answer
```js
//  Parent class
class Person{
    constructor(name,age){
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
}
// child class and invoke
class Doctor extends Person {
  constructor(name, age, specialization) {
    super(name, age); //invoke parent
    this.specialization = specialization;
  }
}

```

# Teacher Feedback

You got part of it! You forgot the last part where you need to create an instance of the child class and reference/invoke a property/method of the parent class.
